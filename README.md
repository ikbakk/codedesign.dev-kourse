The Kourse Hero component is a visually striking and highly functional element of an online course website. It features a clean and modern design, with a large headline on the left side and a featured course card on the right side. Under both the headline and course card, there are two key features that highlight the benefits and features of the online courses offered. The hero component is a key part of the website's overall aesthetic and user experience, and can be used to showcase the benefits and features of the online courses, including their quality, relevance, and convenience.

## How to Start

To begin the challenge, you will first need to download the design file from the provided link. This will give you access to all of the necessary design elements and assets that you will need to complete the challenge.

Next, take some time to study the design and understand how it works. Look at the layout, color scheme, typography, and overall aesthetic to get a sense of the look and feel of the design.

After you have a good understanding of the design, you can start exporting all of the necessary assets. This may include images, fonts, and other elements that you will need to use in your code.

Finally, it's time to start implementing the design into code! Use your exported assets and the design file as a reference as you work to create a functional and visually appealing implementation of the design.
